          <p>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of work and experimentation with <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> lately, and I have to say it&#39;s pretty great.  Naturally, I wanted to write some tests for the components I&#39;ve created, so I decided to try out <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a>.</p>
          <p>Of course, being on Windows and using Visual Studio 2013, there were bound to be gotchas.  I ran into some minor trouble trying to get Jest installed through npm, but with some research I was able to get things working.  This post is mostly to document the command that was able to work for in the hopes that it could help someone like me in the same situation.</p>

          <time>July 26, 2014</time>
          <p>After pushing for unit testing at Niche for over a year and a half, there&#39;s finally been some changes happening on our development team in the last few weeks.  We&#39;ve made it mandatory to include proper test coverage with each completed task.  For now, my priority is teaching the team what the word &quot;proper&quot; entails: the <em>what</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>how many</em> of unit testing.  I&#39;ve been doing this in the form of lunch-and-learns with the team and one-on-ones with some of our newer developers.  By far the most disagreement has centered around the question, &quot;how do I unit test this private method?&quot;  To which I always reply, &quot;you don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

          <p>This website has received a number of facelifts over the years. It seems I&#39;ve spent more time building and less time blogging. &quot;I can&#39;t start writing articles until I have tagging, a nice three-column fluid layout, and this and that,&quot; I told myself. This was back when the first version of jimskerritt.com used <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a>. It had a whopping total of zero articles. Why? Because I spent more time fighting with the framework instead of actually using it to do the thing I wanted to do.</p>

          <p>
            Are you like me and you work on a team that uses SVN, but you would really like to use Git locally? It turns out there is excellent support for doing so using <code>git svn</code>, but it takes a bit of effort to get things set up. After working with <code>git svn</code> for about a month or two now, I decided to write up a guide with my experiences for others looking to continue using Git even if their team doesn&#39;t.

          <p>
            The other day at the office, a conversation began about the hassle of needing a tab of realtime Google Analytics open for each of our websites. We could only Chromecast one or two tabs at a time onto our office TV. Wouldn't it be nice to somehow watch the traffic for each website, along with a running total in realtime, all on one nicely castable tab?
