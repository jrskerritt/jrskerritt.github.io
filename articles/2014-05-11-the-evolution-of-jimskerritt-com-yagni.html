        <h1>The Evolution of jimskerritt.com: YAGNI</h1>
        <time>May 11, 2014</time>
        <p>This website has received a number of facelifts over the years. It seems I&#39;ve spent more time building and less time blogging. &quot;I can&#39;t start writing articles until I have tagging, a nice three-column fluid layout, and this and that,&quot; I told myself. This was back when the first version of jimskerritt.com used <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a>. It had a whopping total of zero articles. Why? Because I spent more time fighting with the framework instead of actually using it to do the thing I wanted to do. It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.</p>
        <p>When I finally felt motivated to start a blog again, I decided to go simpler and use GitHub Pages with documents I would create myself. The layout would use Bootstrap and everything will be simple and life will be grand.</p>
        <p>Wrong. Again, I ended up playing with Bootstrap more than writing articles. Navigation bars, themes, and column layouts were taking up all of my time. While still a valuable learning experience, I wanted to be able to lower the barrier to writing an article as much as possible. Do I really need all of these things that Bootstrap offers, or was I just trying to shoehorn features in because they seemed like they would make my site cooler?</p>
        <p>So I started over, again. This time, I would use no Javascript, no fixed navbars, no multi-column layouts, and no CSS but my own. Just me and my articles. The result was the quickest design I&#39;ve ever come up with. After just a few hours, my site was cleaner and faster, and most importantly, adding articles became incredibly simple. </p>
        <h2>You aren&#39;t gonna need it</h2>
        <p>KISS and YAGNI are virtues that we should all embrace. The lesson here is that I followed neither. I wanted to start a blog. That was my problem. Instead of solving that, I was solving problems about how to add post tagging and create overly complicated layouts. <strong>Solve the problem that you want to solve, and nothing else</strong>.</p>
        <p>Will I need the ability to add comments to my articles? Or tag them? Or organize them by month and year? Sure. Maybe. Eventually. But these are problems I will solve when they <em>actually become problems</em>.</p>

        <p>Build what you need as you need it, aggressively refactoring as you go along; don&#39;t spend a lot of time planning for grandiose, unknown future scenarios. Good software can evolve into what it will ultimately become.</p>
